## 1. Content Intake Layer
- Monitors newly uploaded media
- Extracts metadata and early engagement signals

## 2. Risk Assessment Engine
- Evaluates visual, audio, and behavioral signals
- Produces a probabilistic risk score
- Avoids binary fake/real classification

## 3. Containment Layer
- Reduces algorithmic amplification for high-risk content
- Introduces friction to re-sharing
- Applies contextual labels

## 4. Alert & Audit Layer
- Notifies potential impersonation victims
- Preserves evidence securely
- Logs all system actions for review
