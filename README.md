# Deepfake Containment System

## Overview
This repository presents a system-level design for reducing harm caused by deepfake media.
Rather than focusing only on detection accuracy, the system prioritizes early risk identification,
controlled content spread, contextual labeling, and victim alerting.

All data in this repository is simulated and intended to demonstrate system behavior and decision logic.

---

## Core Principles
- Harm reduction over binary detection
- Proportional and reversible responses
- Transparency and auditability
- Human-centric safeguards

---

## System Capabilities
- Multi-signal manipulation risk scoring
- Virality monitoring and spread control
- Contextual content labeling
- Early victim notification with evidence preservation

---

## What This Repository Is
- A system design prototype
- A logic and data simulation
- Suitable for ideathons and concept validation

## What This Repository Is Not
- A deployed moderation platform
- A claim of perfect deepfake detection
- A censorship or takedown system

---

## Ethical Notice
This project intentionally avoids using or distributing real deepfake media.
All examples are simulated to prevent misuse or unintended harm.
