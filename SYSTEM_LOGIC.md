# Containment Decision Flow

1. Content is uploaded and monitored.
2. Initial engagement velocity is measured.
3. Risk score is calculated using multiple signals.
4. If risk score < 60%:
   - No action taken.
5. If risk score between 60%–80%:
   - Content is monitored closely.
6. If risk score > 80%:
   - Algorithmic amplification is reduced.
   - Re-share friction is enabled.
   - Contextual label is applied.
   - Evidence snapshot is archived.
7. If identity misuse likelihood is high:
   - Victim alert is triggered.

All actions are reversible and logged.
